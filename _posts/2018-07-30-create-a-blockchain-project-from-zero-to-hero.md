This is a note for a future doc on howto **create a blockchain** project which can be expanded on later.

  1. Run [komodod](https://i.mylomylo.com/build-komodo-source/) with your chain parameters
  2. Your chain data is kept in ~/.komodo/CHAINNAME
  3. You need an icon for your [wallet](https://i.mylomylo.com/update-agama-wallet-uninstall-reinstall/)
  4. You need to know your chain parameters for the [wallet](https://i.mylomylo.com/agama-wallet-app-first-install/)
  5. You need to know what information to provide for inclusion in the [DEX](https://i.mylomylo.com/dex-altcoin-trading-base-pair-to-bitcoin-others/) network
  6. [Secure your blockchain](https://i.mylomylo.com/blockchain-security-for-dapps-ecosystems/) project you create to bitcoin hashrate for best security

Other things to note are, what type of project is it &#8211; will it be a community project or a permissioned project for enterprise style of usage.

Here&#8217;s a short of youtube video / podcast the [Komodo Pioneers](https://komodopioneers.com) did with Komodo Team Member &#8220;@Alright&#8221;
