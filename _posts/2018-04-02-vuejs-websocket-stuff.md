I started poking around the Komodo’s BarterDEX GUI source code a couple of weeks ago before running into some unexpected work in fiat world as well as some Komodo notary node setup on testnet.

It’s an electron app with a plain html css jquery front end.

My iPad has some older tabs to revisit when more Vue dev happens with integrating with marketmaker by curl request.
