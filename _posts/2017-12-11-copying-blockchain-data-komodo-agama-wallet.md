Copying blockchain data will save download time every time &#8211; any blockchain. So it&#8217;s probably a good idea to know how to copy the relevant files and other stuff like LOCK files etc.

This page is just info about copying the blockchain from a mac to a windows machine.

Komodo has two directories/folders for the data that need to be copied: blocks & chainstate

Make sure Agama wallet is closed so the blocks and chainstate are static/stable/no-changing.

## Copying Blockchain Data From a Mac

  1. Open finder and go to this folder: /Users/mylo/Library/Application Support/Komodo
  2. Copy the folders &#8220;blocks&#8221; & &#8220;chainstate&#8221; to your storage (USB).

## Copying Blockchain Data To Windows

  1. Open windows explorer at: C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\Komodo
  2. Copy from your USB &#8220;blocks&#8221; & &#8220;chainstate&#8221; to the Komodo folder.

## Blockchain Data Synced!

Now open up Agama Wallet on windows, wait a moment or two and the chain is synced, saving a 2.5GB download!
