Hi! My KMD Address for donations is: **RWzqTpKuDDFE5GnUgd3u7NPZ1mvrNuAoVg**

**December 11:** The WordPress PWA plugin mustn&#8217;t be registering the service worker to download stuff for offline viewing if you &#8220;Save this site to Home Screen&#8221;.

**November 20:** Moved site from dedicated server back to AWS EC2 because blockchain testing takes it&#8217;s toll on server resources, and no mining.

**October 31:** Added PWA plugin to the site &#8211; allows Android users to save this website as a progressive web app.

## As at October 2017

this site is a simple wordpress blog.  it runs in a KVM guest (linux virtualisation) with 2GB RAM on a physical core-i7-2700 which has 16GB RAM.  the guest runs the [plesk admin pro edition](https://www.plesk.com/pricing/) for hosting simplicity &#8211; for the die hard command line system administrators (like me), it saves a lot of time to dedicated to other tasks.

the host machine mines monero with spare (5 out of the 8 threads) cpu cycles which generate about 0.5 XMR every 3 months.  so if this site is slow, it&#8217;s because it doesn&#8217;t have advertising and i am mining on the server, not your browser.

the host machine has been a live playground for my kvm virtualisation interests.
