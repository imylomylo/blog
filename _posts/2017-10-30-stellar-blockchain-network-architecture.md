Something to look at, install etc.

[Stellar network anchor server architecture](https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/anchor/index.html)

Getting Stellar Lumens for the mandatory participatory 20 XLM needed can be done through [changelly](https://changelly.com/) quite easily.

Easy to use but feature incomplete wallet for mobile and desktop called stargazer from the [stellar wallets page](https://www.stellar.org/lumens/wallets/).
