One of many projects that exist but don&#8217;t get the attention of the wider population is community based internet access using cryptocurrency.  A colleague on the komodo team referred me to these topics in a quick conversation:

  * [Althea](http://altheamesh.com/), an incentivised internet access project
  * [Friefunk](https://freifunk.net/en/how-to-join/find-your-nearest-community/), community internet

The incentivisation is simple:  allow others to connect to your internet and get rewarded.  The software platforms involved allow for privacy.  As dApps gain usage, more and more use-cases will present themselves as handy, fairer, more accessible alternatives.

Any enquiries for research and development, please contact me via this form for an introduction to the SuperNET&#8217;s Spacemesh team within the Komodo Platform Cryptocurrency Project.
