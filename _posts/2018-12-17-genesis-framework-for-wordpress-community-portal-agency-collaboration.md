This is just a short post to test some of the layout with this new Agency Pro theme running on the Genesis Framework.   I am a recent convert, about 3 months &#8211; but haven&#8217;t had much time to dig into customizations&#8230;or I haven&#8217;t really had a need to.

Another project got me started on the Genesis Framework.  Komodo&#8217;s notary operator &#8220;Alien&#8221; put me onto Genesis.  His [blog had 150k views in a month and he said it was a fast framework](https://techloverhd.com/) &#8211; so I looked at the documentation and was quite happy to make the purchase.

I&#8217;m onto my 2nd theme &#8211; for this blog, but it&#8217;s for an agency startup.  The featured images need a bit of a massage.

The first theme I started working with was for the Komodo Platform community news site &#8211; which is currently on hold.  Here&#8217;s what it looked like last draft.  More info on a [Komodo Tech Tuesday](https://komodoplatform.com/tech-tuesday-update/) coming up.

Both are pretty stock standard.  They are responsive and are well worth the money for starter projects to compare the [merits of including different assets into a rebrand](https://komodoplatform.com/komodo-platform-ideas-by-nature-rebranding/).
