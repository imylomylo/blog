I am not involved with the XVG Project, but it&#8217;s mooning in December 2017 has been impressive with a 40x increase.    The market is (nonsensical) crazy, I think XVG is the biggest pump of 2017.  This post is a quick analysis about it&#8217;s accessibility and information about the project and what I perceive to be important.  I do not hold any XVG, but this post will focus on the positives.

      * Very active, every post on the front page is within 24 hours, it is fresh
      * Excitement in the community on it&#8217;s 40x recent price rise as expected, 150% in last 24 hours (again!)
  * Developers not only can access the github repos, verge links to how to install rubygems as well as the github desktop &#8211; when more developers are using the same tools, it&#8217;s a more streamlined developer experience for onboarding new devs.
