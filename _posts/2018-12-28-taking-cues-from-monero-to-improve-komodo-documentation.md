When I first stumbled across [Komodo](https://komodoplatform.com) in 2017, there wasn’t a lot of documentation, so referring to zCash and bitcoin docs was necessary.  These days the komodo documentation includes some [developer docs for the new chain logic (smart contract + more) features](https://developers.komodoplatform.com) (by @siddhartha & @gcharang), and some [handbook style docs](https://docs.komodoplatform.com) (originally compiled by @gcharang).

However, I remember needing to ask @goldenman how he got his [C++ stuff to compile](https://github.com/imylomylo/komodo-notarynode-mined-counter) because you either knew or you didn’t know.  In the most rare cases (4 times in 10 years) I will fiddle around with C or C++ to do something.

Today I came across some [monero C++ examples](https://moneroexamples.github.io/access-blockchain-in-cpp/) which immediately were impressive.  I am on an iPad so cannot test what is written but that isn’t the point.

[Komodo has a client library for embedding](https://github.com/imylomylo/komodoAPI-cpp) which needs documenting for the new year!
