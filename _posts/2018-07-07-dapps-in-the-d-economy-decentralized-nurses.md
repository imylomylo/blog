<p class="p1">
  In the coming age of decentralization, programmable money and the d-economy, machine to machine services will trade their value autonomously and quickly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What about people?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Currently nearly all services consumed and produced work in a centralised manner.  This post is about a project for decentralized nurses.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  My first business was nurse call integration with the private telephony networks to more efficiently enable nurses to receive paging messages from their patients.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a patient, you would press a button to get the nurse to come to attend to your needs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This business was short lived &#8211; I quickly found the lead time between quoting, system delivery and payment to be a challenge to entrepreneurial survival.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  What is left of that endeavour is the source code, although the history of development is lost.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The last snapshot from around 2006 exists.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This has been retrieved from a backup and the <a href="https://github.com/proplatformers/nursepaging">nurse call integration source code has been posted to GitHub</a>.

## Decentralized Nurses &#8211; Evolution of Nursepaging {.p1}

<p class="p1">
  A short time ago on the <a href="https://i.mylomylo.com/build-komodo-source/">Komodo</a> Platform reddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/komodoplatform/comments/8rv5od/how_many_dapps_are_on_or_plan_on_using_komodo/e0v2fxh/?st=jjb4ll7f&sh=6187fb71">a user enquired about what dApps will be built on it</a> &#8211; to which I responded with the idea of evolving the old nurse paging business with some prototypes and some fund raising to get the project to market.
</p>

## Independence of Aged Parents {.p1}

<p class="p1">
  Modern society has changed over the past decades where the baby boomer generation want to retain their independence &#8211; this means more people are aging in their own homes rather than aged care residences.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This may put a little extra pressure on friends and family to provide more care and an interdependence to maintain a quality of life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is where technology can play a nice complementary role.
</p>

## Midwives and Pregnancy {.p1}

<p class="p1">
  Taking notes during a pregnancy and assisting during a process I know little about is what midwives do.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What I am sure about is most midwives find the administration of their job the most stressful.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Be it using computers and devices they know nothing about at a technical level or merely sitting down to research, communicate or type up reports and recommendations.
</p>

## dApps for Decentralized Nurses {.p1}

<p class="p1">
  Technology has changed a lot since my first business.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The IT people of the places I installed my software, if they had an IT person, didn’t even have LANs or fixed internet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My maintenance was done over remote modem sessions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What we now have available are online services that convert voice to text, mobile devices that are more powerful than the systems I used to sell and applied maths in the form of blockchain solutions.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  The two examples above, aged parents and midwives are the primary solutions to the first steps in making dApps for Nurses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They will be prototyped using <a href="https://komodoplatform.com/komodo-platforms-new-scalability-tech/">Komodo Platform’s scalable and secure blockchain</a> in combination with mobile apps and services built on <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS (the decentralized web aka interplanetary file system)</a>.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  This is the first announcement for this project/vision.
