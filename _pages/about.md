I moved this blog from wordpress to jekyll because too many wordpress sites was getting annoying, for one dude to keep interest in.  This is the most lightweight personal blog I can have.  I have some customer sites and some collaboration sites on wordpress - and they'll stay that way.

Jekyll serves my needs and the liquid templating language is used by shopify.

This medium-esque theme is made with <i class="fa fa-heart text-danger"></i> by Sal [@wowthemesnet](https://www.wowthemes.net/category/free-themes-templates/).  I ended up using jekyll because of the <a href="https://komodoelection.com">Komodo Election</a> site runs on it and we needed something lightweight with collaborative editing.  Even people unfamiliar with github were happy with the workflow!
